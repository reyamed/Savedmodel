# Savedmodel
## Introduction 
- this is an SSD-mobilenet V2 fine tuned object detection model trained on a custom dataset (13 classes) tensorflow 2.5.
## steps of training
1- create a new virtual environnement 
```sh
      Conda create -n nameproject python=3.6
```
2. install object detection api with tensorflow: 
```sh
     git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models
```
3. proceeds to training 

## Deployment on OpenCV
